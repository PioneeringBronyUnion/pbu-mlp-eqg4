有一本书
内容还都是
空白
这书是我们的生活
故事要我们来
编写
有些书页褪色
有些则变成
黑白
故事会再度开始
只要我们去
努力
只要我们去努力
希望之光永照
朋友便是我所需
希望之光永照
未来永远光彩
只要你在我身边
我努力穿过黑暗
从另一边
出来
乌云会为
晴朗的天空
让开
我曾畏惧
熬过最长的
夜晚
但是早晨还会来
带来明媚的阳光
希望之光永照
朋友便是我所需
希望之光永照
未来永远光彩
未来永远光彩
是的未来永远光彩
只要你在我身边


Somewhere's a book
With chapters still blank
Insi-i-ide
It's the book of our lives
And the story is ours
To write
Some pages fade
While others are black
And whi-i-ite
And the story begins
Again every time
We try
Every time we try
And hope shines eternal
And friends are all I need
And hope shines eternal
And the future is always bri-i-ight
When you're here with me
I fought through the darkness
And come out the
Other si-i-de
For rain clouds will clear
The way for the
Sunny skies
I've been afraid
And stayed through the longest
Ni-i-ights
But morning still comes
And with it, it brings a light
And hope shines eternal
And friends are all I need
And hope shines eternal
And the future is always bri-i-i-ight
The future is always bri-i-ight
Yeah, the future is always bri-i-i-ight
When you're here with me
