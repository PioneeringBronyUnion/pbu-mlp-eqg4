现在是盖亚森灵传说的故事时间

Many years ago my great grandparents came to this forest.
很久很久以前，我的曾祖父母来到这个森林

Seeing its beauty, they decided that it would be the perfect place for a camp.
看到这美丽景象，他们认为这里是野营的绝佳选择

But once they started building, strange things started to happen.
但当他们开始修房子时，奇怪的事发生了

One pitch-black night, when the wind was howling,
一个漆黑的夜里，山风咆哮

a tree branch crashed through the roof of their cabin.
一棵树被吹倒在他们的房顶上

They screamed and ran outside,
他们尖叫着逃出来

only to see the giant creature rising from the earth.
只看到一只巨大的生物从土地里长起来

She got wild hair, like the roots of a tree.
她有着杂乱的树根头发

Her mouth had jagged rock teeth and her eyes were pools of black tar.
岩石般参差的牙齿和焦油般漆黑的眼睛

But her aura shimmered like diamonds.
但她被宝石一样的光亮笼罩着

Anywhere she went, she left a trail of gemdust in her wake.
不论她到哪，她都在身后留下一串宝石屑

Trembling, my great grandparents asked who she was and she wanted.
我的曾祖母颤抖着问她的来历和需要

In a deep and hollow voice she told them that her name was Gaia Everfree –
她用深沉而空洞的声音，告诉他们自己的名字叫“盖亚森灵”

an ancient spirit who held domain over the forest,
一个守护这片森林的古魂

and that my great grandparent were trespassing on her land.
同时警告他们不要侵犯领土权

They begged her to let them stay and build their camp
他们祈求她允许在此停留建造野营地

to share this wonderful place with others.
把这片圣地分享给他人

Gaia Everfree finally agreed,
盖亚森灵终于同意了

but warned them that they would not be able to keep it forever.
但是警告道这片领土不会永远给他们

Some day she will return and reclaim the forest as her own.
总有一天她会回来重新开拓这片森林的

So if you see a trail of gemdust, you'll know that it is...
因此如果你看见一串宝石屑的话，你就知道那会是...

Gaia Everfree!
盖亚森灵！

Gloriosa Daisy: Hey, guys! Sorry, didn't mean to scare you!
嘿伙计们！抱歉我不是刻意吓你们的

Sunset Shimmer: Then why'd you come out of the bushes?
那你怎么从灌木里跑出来了？

Gloriosa Daisy: I... took the scenic route, because the forest is beautiful at night.

But no one else should do it without a guide, okay?

Alright, everybody, time to head to you tents.

Snips: Oh, hey, Gloriosa.

Fluttershy: Sorry, Spike. I guess that story got to me.
抱歉，史派克，这故事大概是吓着我了

Applejack: Why? It can't be real.

Gaia Everfree could be some creature that got booted from Equestria
盖亚森灵可能是从小马国流放出来的某种生物

and ended up in this world. That's what happened with the sirens.
并在这个世界里生存，海妖也就是这样的

Applejack: Eh. Sounded more like something that Timber was making up just to scare us.
呃，听着更像是云杉棕木编故事来吓我们

At least I hope it was.

Last thing I want is to have camp ruined by some power-crazed magical creature.
