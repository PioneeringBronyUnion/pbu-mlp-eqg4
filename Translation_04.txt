Many years ago my great grandparents came to this forest.
很久很久以前，我的曾祖父母来了到这个森林

Seeing its beauty, they decided that it would be the perfect place for a camp.
看到这美丽景象，他们认为这里是修建营地的绝佳选择

But once they started building, strange things started to happen.
但当他们开始修房子时，奇怪的事情发生了

One pitch-black night, when the wind was howling,
一个漆黑的夜里，山风咆哮

a tree branch crashed through the roof of their cabin.
一棵树被吹倒在他们的房顶上

They screamed and ran outside,
他们尖叫着逃出来

only to see the giant creature rising from the earth.

She got wild hair like the roots of a tree.
她有着树根般杂乱的头发

Her mouth had jagged rock teeth and her eyes were pools of black tar.
岩石般参差的牙齿，和焦油般漆黑的眼睛

But her aura shimmered like diamonds.
但她被宝石一样的光亮笼罩着

Anywhere she went, she left a trail of gem dust in her wake.
不论她到哪，她都在身后留下一串宝石屑

Trembling, my great grandparents asked who she was and she wanted.
我的曾祖父母颤抖着问她的来历和需要

In a deep and hollow voice she told them that her name was Gaia Everfree –
她用深沉而空洞的声音，告诉他们她的名字叫“森灵盖亚”

an ancient spirit who held domain over the forest,
一个守护着这片森林的古魂

and that my great grandparent were trespassing on her land.
她说我的曾祖父母们侵入了她的领土

They begged her to let them stay and build their camp

to share this wonderful place with others.

Gaia Everfree finally agreed,

but warned them that they would not be able to keep it forever.
但是警告他们这片领土不会永远给他们

Some day she will return

and reclaim the forest as her own.
收回这片森林的

So if you see a trail of gem dust, you'll know that it is...
因此如果你看见一串宝石屑的话，你就知道那是...

Gaia Everfree!
森灵盖亚！

Gloriosa Daisy: Hey, guys! Sorry, didn't mean to scare you!
