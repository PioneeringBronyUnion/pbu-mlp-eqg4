Rarity: Sorry, girls.


I didn't mean to.


And I don't know how to control this.


Rainbow Dash: It's okay.


Fluttershy: Oh, none of us do.


Sunset Shimmer: Which is why we shouldn't pretend this isn't happening.


Rainbow Dash: Do you have it now, too?


Sunset Shimmer: It started last night.


When I touch people,


it's like I can feel what they're feeling and see their memories.


Pinkie Pie: Oooh, fancy! Try me, try me!


Pinkie Pie: Lalalala. Ooh, taffy!


Sunset Shimmer: That explains so much.


Pinkie Pie: Yep.


Sunset Shimmer: Girls, we can't just brush these powers aside,


because it doesn't seem like the ideal time to get them.


What if it turns out that they could actually make things better?
