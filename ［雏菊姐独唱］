守候于此天昏黑
誓要驱逐贪狼回
神秘的魔法助我为神
雄伟缭绕据于我身
定 要 守护这营地
仰望那自然的恩赐，荣美而华丽
不惧那贪婪之人眉睫翘
我会守护你 战至最后
于荆之壁怒吼
为森灵地 永不沦落
前方的战火燃我眉
铁链之下吾土危
但我们守护它代代至深
混乱只不过是须臾之时
定 要 保卫这营地！
相信我 一切不会辜负
不要颤巍
自然伴吾身
围绕我们不止美丽繁华
花朵的美丽 是自卫的伪装
来啊 放马都过来！
才不会轻易退下来！
营地会于此永驻万世
被世界纪录于广阔历史
定 要 保卫这营地！

I have waited for the day
To send this greedy wolf away
Now the magic is my salvation
Gather close in my protection
We will stand for Everfree!
Behold the beauty of nature in all its glory
No need to fear the vultures at the door
Right here you have me to protect you
Within these walls of thorns
For Everfree forevermore!
They have come into our domain
Here to seal our camp in chains
But we have held it for generations
This is just a complication
We will stand for Everfree!
Trust in me, this is for your own good
Don't be afraid
Nature is our friend
All of this beauty that surrounds us
Every lovely bloom designed to defend
Let them come! Just let them try!
I'm not about to say goodbye!
This camp will be here throughout the ages
Written into the history pages
We will stand for Everfree!
