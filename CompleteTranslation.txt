我的曾祖父母颤抖着问她是谁和她的意图

In a deep and hollow voice she told them that her name was Gaia Everfree –
她用深沉而空洞的声音，告诉他们她的名字叫“森灵盖亚”

an ancient spirit who held domain over the forest,
一个守护着这片森林的古魂

and that my great grandparent were trespassing on her land.
而我的曾祖父母们侵入了她的领土

They begged her to let them stay and build their camp

to share this wonderful place with others.

Some day she will return

and reclaim the forest as her own.

So if you see a trail of gem dust, you'll know that it is...

Gaia Everfree!
森灵盖亚！

Gloriosa Daisy: Hey, guys! Sorry, didn't mean to scare you!
嘿伙计们！抱歉，不是刻意要吓你们的

Sunset Shimmer: Then why'd you come out of the bushes?
