Gloriosa Daisy: Thank you all so much for coming.


And for helping us raise enough money to... save Camp Everfree!


Gloriosa Daisy: Thank you for everything.


Oh, if I just asked for help in the first place.


Rainbow Dash: Heh, don't sweat it, it's kinda what we do.


Timber Spruce: Not to brag or anything,


but it's pretty cool how I saved all those campers from those Rubus fruticosus.


Blackberry brambles.


Twilight Sparkle: I'm familiar with the genus,


it's just a little weird you say you saved the campers.


I thought I saved them.


Timber Spruce: Yeah.


But I saved you from falling on the docks,


so that you can save the campers.


So technically, it was all me.


Twilight Sparkle: I'm really glad I met you.


Timber Spruce: Uh-oh.


Twilight Sparkle: What?


Timber Spruce: That sounds like a goodbye.


And here I was hoping we'd still be able to hang out.


Maybe get dinner and catch a movie?


Twilight Sparkle: Yeah. I'd really like that.


Timber Spruce: Oh, good!


I was hoping that's what this meant.


Gloriosa Daisy: Oh, uh, sorry.


I need to borrow Timber.


There are some donors I really want him to meet.


They were good friends with mom and dad.


Timber Spruce: Save me a dance, okay?


Twilight Sparkle: Uh-hah.


Rarity: Adorable.


Sunset Shimmer: He does seem like a pretty cool guy.


Rainbow Dash: You know what else is cool?


Our awesome new superpowers!


Rainbow Dash: I handed out, like, four hundred fliers,


set up the stage,


and still had time to pick up pizza!


I love my superspeed!


Sunset Shimmer: About that.


I think the crystals are the source of the superpowers.


FLuttershy: You're not gonna ask us to give them up, are you?


Sunset Shimmer: No.


In fact, I think maybe we were meant to have them all along?


Twilight Sparkle: Me too.


Sunset Shimmer: There is one thing I'm still wondering about, though.


Twilight Sparkle: What's that?


Sunset Shimmer: Where did the magic that hit come from?
